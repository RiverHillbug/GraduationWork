# GraduationWork
In this project, I am developing an alternative method for line-of-sight calculations, utilizing depth maps instead of raycasting.

## Research Question

**RQ1:** How do ray casting and depth map comparison methods compare for vision detection in games in terms of performance and development efficiency?

**RQ2:** For which agent count and target count parameters, if any, does depth map comparison method result in better performance than ray casting?
